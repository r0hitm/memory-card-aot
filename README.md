# 進撃の巨人 (Attack on Titan) inspired Memory Card Game

This is a memory card game inspired by the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-memory-card). And is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and Reactjs.

I have themed the game to be inspired by the anime [進撃の巨人 (Attack on Titan)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan_(TV_series)), which is one of my favourite anime.

## How to play

The objective is to click on each picture exactly once to score a point. Clicking on the same picture twice should end the game and reset the current score while recording the best score achieved so far. The order of the cards should be randomized after each time the user clicks, adding an element of unpredictability and challenge to the game.
